# Apache Myriad Repository Has Moved

Apache Myriad is now an Apache Incubator project, and we have moved all the development activities onto Apache infrastructure. You can find the latest information on the [Apache Myriad website](http://myriad.incubator.apache.org/), but here's a quick summary:

### Source Code
To checkout source code from Apache's git repository:

```bash
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-myriad.git
```

If you prefer Github, you can use our [Github mirror](https://github.com/apache/incubator-myriad):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-myriad.git
```

### Issue Tracking
The project now uses Apache's [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYRIAD) for issue tracking.
